# Basic-Calculator
Welcome To my project, here I have made a Basic Calculator that can do the following tasks like:

A. Basic Tasks: i. Addition,  ii. Subtraction,  iii. Multiplication,   iv. Division.

B. Advance Tasks: i. Percentage Calculation,   ii. Finding power values (square, cube, x to the power 4, and so on),   iii. Finding Roots (square root, cube root, and so on).


It can Handle errors properly, like it shows error when we divide anything by 0, or root of 0, etc. 


It is highly responsive and has three different delete functions:

i. C : This will clear everything,

ii. CE: This will clear the last element, for example, if we type 1+2 and press CE, it will clear elemet 2, hence we got 1+ , then we can again enter a new value, like 3, this will show 1+3 instead of 2, so answer will bw 4.

iii. DEL: This will delete single digits, for example,  if we type 1200+255 and press DEL, it will clear 255 one by one first 5, then 5, then 2, then + and so on.


It is visually interesting, and user will be able to know which button he/she had pressed, but user can only use calculator's keys to type not their actual keyboard, to make it better and clean.

The Calculations are fully done via Javascript.
